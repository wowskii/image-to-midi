"""You might wanna know:
The MIDI output is a long reel of "frames" where each frame corresponds to a frame in the video.
You can go through these frames by scrolling horizontally in your MIDI viewer. For FL Studio users, it helps to turn off animations in Settings > General, to avoid lag when scrolling.
I personally use this python script to scroll automatically: """
